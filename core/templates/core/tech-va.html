    <details class="bg-white rounded-lg shadow-sm p-4">
      <summary class="font-semibold cursor-pointer">How does a Tech VA help with AI search?</summary>
      <p class="mt-3 text-gray-700 px-4">
        A Tech VA helps prepare your website for AI-driven search results by structuring your content in ways
        search engines can easily understand. This usually means creating cluster pages around your core topics,
        writing FAQs that mirror real customer questions, and adding schema markup to highlight those answers
        in search engines. Together, these steps increase your chances of being featured in AI Overviews,
        rich snippets, and voice search results, giving you more visibility without relying on paid ads.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details class="bg-white rounded-lg shadow-sm p-4">
      <summary class="font-semibold cursor-pointer">Can a Tech VA set up Systeme.io for me?</summary>
      <p class="mt-3 text-gray-700 px-4">
        Yes. Many Tech VAs, including Djangify, can set up Systeme.io for you from start to finish. This includes
        creating sales funnels, connecting payment gateways, and building automated email sequences so you can
        start selling products or services online without juggling multiple tools. If you’re not confident with
        tech setup, having a VA handle Systeme.io means you avoid common mistakes and can focus on your business,
        knowing that your marketing systems are running smoothly in the background.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details class="bg-white rounded-lg shadow-sm p-4">
      <summary class="font-semibold cursor-pointer">What tasks should I delegate to a Tech VA?</summary>
      <p class="mt-3 text-gray-700 px-4">
        A Tech VA is most valuable when handling time-consuming but essential tasks that keep your business
        running. You might delegate website fixes, content organisation, schema markup, and setting up lead
        capture forms. They can also manage your email tools, integrate services like Calendly or Stripe, and
        create templates or checklists so you have systems in place. By outsourcing these jobs, you get to stay
        focused on strategy, sales, and customer relationships instead of worrying about whether your site is
        technically correct or AI-search ready.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details class="bg-white rounded-lg shadow-sm p-4">
      <summary class="font-semibold cursor-pointer">Do I need to know tech to work with a Tech VA?</summary>
      <p class="mt-3 text-gray-700 px-4">
        Not at all. The whole point of hiring a Tech VA is to take technical tasks off your plate so you can
        concentrate on running your business. A good Tech VA will explain what they’re doing in plain language,
        set up the tools you need, and give you simple instructions if there’s anything you need to manage
        yourself. Whether it’s AI search readiness, Systeme.io setup, or general website fixes, they’ll bridge
        the gap between technology and business so you don’t have to become a tech expert.
