        A Tech VA prepares your website for AI-driven search by organising content into topic clusters,  
        adding FAQ schema, and ensuring key pages answer user questions directly.  
        These structured updates help Google’s AI Overviews, Bing Copilot, and other search assistants  
        understand your content and surface it in results.  
        You’ll improve visibility and trust without spending on ads — a smart, sustainable SEO foundation for small businesses.

        Yes. I can build your Systeme.io setup from start to finish — including landing pages, payment integration,  
        automations, and email sequences. Systeme.io brings all your marketing tools together so you can manage  
        your entire business in one place.  
        This setup eliminates the need for multiple subscriptions, reduces tech stress, and gives you a tested, ready-to-run marketing system that’s easy to maintain.

        A Tech VA can also set up your email tools, organise your digital files, and implement tracking for analytics.
