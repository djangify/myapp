      <h2>What Does a Digital Marketing Specialist Do?</h2>
      <p>
        A Digital Marketing Specialist helps small businesses put the right online systems in place. 
        That means creating a connected setup of tools and strategies that work together: 
        all-in-one platforms for efficiency, email sequences to build trust, content that answers real questions, 
        and websites ready for AI-driven search. 
        It is not about doing everything, it is about building systems that last.
      </p>

      <p>
        Most business owners feel overwhelmed by too many tools and too much jargon.  
        A Digital Marketing Specialist can simplify your marketing so you save time and create a steady flow of customers.

      <p>The cost of digital marketing depends on what you need. Some business owners simply buy a PDF guide to follow step by step, while others prefer a done-for-you setup.
