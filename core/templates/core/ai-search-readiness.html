    <p>
      Search is changing. Instead of showing a list of links, Google, Bing, and AI tools now deliver direct answers. This guide helps you prepare your website with cluster pages, FAQs, and schema so your content gets chosen.

      <h2>What Does AI Search Readiness Mean?</h2>
      <p>
        Being AI-search ready means structuring your content so AI tools can easily recognise, trust, and use it in answers. This includes building cluster pages, writing FAQs, and adding schema markup. When your site is AI-friendly, you are more likely to be featured in answer boxes, summaries, and overviews.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Why It Matters</h3>
      <p>
        AI overviews are already here. Sites that adapt now will capture visibility and leads, while others risk being invisible. Getting AI-ready is no longer optional.

  <!-- Quick Answers -->
  <section class="mt-16">
    <h2>Quick Answers About AI Search Readiness</h2>
    <div class="space-y-6">
      <div>
        <h3>What is AI search readiness?</h3>
        <p>AI search readiness means structuring your website so artificial intelligence tools such as Google’s AI Overviews, Bing Copilot, and ChatGPT can easily understand and use your content. It involves creating topic clusters, adding FAQs, applying schema markup, and formatting content for clarity. The goal is to increase your chances of being chosen as the direct source in AI-generated answers.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Do I need coding skills?</h3>
        <p>No coding skills are required to make your site AI-search ready. Most tasks, such as adding FAQs, writing cluster pages, or generating schema markup, can be done with free online tools or copy-and-paste code. Even non-technical business owners can follow simple steps and checklists to prepare their website for AI-driven visibility.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Is this the same as SEO?</h3>
        <p>AI search readiness builds on traditional SEO but goes further. SEO ensures your site ranks in search results, while AI readiness ensures your content is structured so AI tools can pull it into answer boxes and summaries. In practice, it means you still optimise for keywords, but you also format your content in ways that AI can interpret and reuse.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>How long does it take to get results?</h3>
        <p>The time frame depends on your current site health and how quickly search engines crawl your changes. Many small business websites notice improvements within a few weeks after adding FAQs, schema, and cluster pages. AI snippets may appear gradually, and consistency is key, each new piece of structured content builds your authority over time.</p>

    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    <div class="max-w-3xl space-y-4">
      <details class="bg-white rounded-lg shadow-sm p-4">
        <summary class="font-semibold cursor-pointer">Do I need schema for AI search?</summary>
        <p>Schema is not strictly required, but it significantly increases your chances of appearing in AI-generated answers and rich results. Schema markup is a way of labelling your content in code so search engines instantly know whether a page is a product, article, FAQ, or how-to. By adding schema, you reduce confusion and signal that your site is trustworthy and relevant.</p>
      </details>
      <details class="bg-white rounded-lg shadow-sm p-4">
        <summary class="font-semibold cursor-pointer">Can I make my site AI-ready myself?</summary>
        <p>Yes — most business owners can implement AI readiness themselves by following structured guides. Start by defining your main topics, creating cluster pages, and adding FAQs. Then use free schema generators to create the code and paste it into your site. While a Tech VA can speed things up, many DIY checklists and toolkits make it realistic to do on your own. If you don't want to do this yourself considering asking a Tech VA to do it for you ;)</p>
      </details>
      <details class="bg-white rounded-lg shadow-sm p-4">
        <summary class="font-semibold cursor-pointer">Does AI search readiness replace SEO?</summary>
        <p>No, AI readiness doesn’t replace SEO — it complements it. SEO still matters for driving visibility, keywords, and traffic, but AI readiness makes sure your content gets picked up in summaries, not just rankings. Think of SEO as the foundation and AI readiness as the next layer that prepares your content for how search is evolving.</p>

      <details class="bg-white rounded-lg shadow-sm p-4">
        <summary class="font-semibold cursor-pointer">Is Systeme.io or ShopWired AI-ready?</summary>
        <p>Both Systeme.io and ShopWired support the structure you need for AI search readiness. They allow you to create organised cluster pages, publish FAQs, and add schema markup through built-in fields or custom code. If you are using these platforms, you already have a strong base for preparing your site for AI-driven search results.</p>
