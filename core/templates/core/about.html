    <!-- My Journey -->

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-indigo-700 mb-3">My Journey</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
        I started in online marketing and community building back in 2007, 
        grew membership sites, ran SEO services with Little Fish Digital Media, 
        and retrained as a full stack developer specialising in ecommerce. 
        Today, I combine those skills as a Tech VA to support small businesses.

    <!-- Why Systeme.io -->
    <div class="rounded-lg border border-indigo-700 p-6 bg-white shadow-sm">
      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-indigo-700 mb-3">Why Systeme.io</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
        Systeme.io is one of the best all-in-one solutions I’ve found. 
        It gives you funnels, websites, email, automation, and memberships all in one place. 
        That means fewer tools, less cost, and simpler management.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Why ShopWired -->
    <div class="rounded-lg border border-indigo-700 p-6 bg-white shadow-sm">
      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-indigo-700 mb-3">Why ShopWired</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
        For ecommerce, I recommend ShopWired, the best UK alternative to Shopify. 
        It’s built for UK businesses, handles VAT properly, and has excellent support. 
        As a developer with ecommerce expertise, I trust it for small business owners selling online.

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-indigo-700 mb-3">What This Means For You</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
        You get choice: affordable DIY PDFs to guide you step by step, or 
        done-for-you services where I set up your funnels, websites, or ecommerce store. 
        Either way, your systems are simplified, professional, and AI-search ready.
