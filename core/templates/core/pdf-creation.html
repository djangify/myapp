        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold">What is the benefit of having a business PDF?</h3>
        <p class="mt-2 text-[color:var(--color-font-main)]">
          A professional PDF provides a lasting resource for lead generation, client education, or direct sales.
          Unlike social media posts, which disappear quickly, PDFs are downloaded, saved, and often shared.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold">How long should a business PDF be?</h3>
        <p class="mt-2 text-[color:var(--color-font-main)]">
          Most effective PDFs run between 8–20 pages — enough to provide value without overwhelming readers.
        </p>

      <div>
        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold">Can I create a PDF myself?</h3>

          Yes, but a done-for-you service saves time and guarantees professional, branded results.

        Not at all. You don’t need design experience to create a professional PDF.  
        I handle layout, branding, and formatting so your content looks clean, consistent, and on-brand.  
        Whether you’re repurposing blog posts or building from scratch, I make sure the finished PDF reflects your business identity.  
        You simply provide your words, images, or ideas, and I turn them into a polished digital product you’ll be proud to share.

      <summary class="font-semibold cursor-pointer">What formats can my PDF be used in?</summary>
      <p class="mt-3 text-[color:var(--color-font-main)] px-4">
        Your PDF can serve multiple purposes — as a lead magnet, a client onboarding resource, a workshop handout, or a paid digital product.  
        Because PDFs open on almost any device, they’re versatile and easy to distribute via email, your website, or online shops.  
        I also optimise files for both screen and print use, so you can share them digitally or offer them as printed materials without losing quality.

    <details class="bg-[color:var(--color-brand-light)] rounded-lg shadow-sm p-4">
      <summary class="font-semibold cursor-pointer">How long does it take to create a business PDF?</summary>
      <p class="mt-3 text-[color:var(--color-font-main)] px-4">
        Simple PDFs, such as checklists or one-page guides, can be completed within a week once I receive your content.  
        Longer documents like workbooks or ebooks typically take two to three weeks.  
        The timeline depends on the amount of content, images, and revisions needed.  
        Every project includes clear milestones and progress updates, so you’ll know exactly when your final PDF will be ready to publish or sell.

    <details class="bg-[color:var(--color-brand-light)] rounded-lg shadow-sm p-4">
      <summary class="font-semibold cursor-pointer">What’s the difference between a PDF and an ebook?</summary>
      <p class="mt-3 text-[color:var(--color-font-main)] px-4">
        A PDF keeps your layout, fonts, and images exactly as designed, which is ideal for branded materials, guides, and workbooks.  
        An ebook, on the other hand, is reflowable text — better for long-form reading on Kindle or mobile devices.  
        For most small businesses, PDFs are more practical because they maintain your professional look, can include links and visuals, and are easy to download and share.
