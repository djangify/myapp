    "introduction": "",
    "content": "<p>I have been sliding into something called depth studying without knowing it. Thank God for this great video that has helped me avoid the situation and for Chatgpt that wrote an article for me on the topic!</p>\n<div>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzCTHdm0T_Q</div>\n<p><strong>Breadth-Based Learning: Exploring a Holistic Approach to Education</strong></p>\n<p><br/>\r\nIn traditional education, students often specialise in a particular field, focusing their studies on a narrow set of subjects. However, an alternative approach known as breadth-based learning emphasizes the importance of acquiring knowledge across a wide range of disciplines. This essay aims to explore what breadth-based learning entails, its significance in today's rapidly evolving world, and alternatives that may provide a better educational experience.</p>\n<p><strong>Understanding Breadth-Based Learning:</strong><br/>\r\nBreadth-based learning is an educational philosophy that promotes interdisciplinary exploration and a diverse range of subjects. It encourages students to delve into various disciplines, including humanities, sciences, arts, and social sciences, rather than solely specializing in one area. By embracing breadth, students acquire a broader perspective and develop versatile skills that can be applied across multiple domains.</p>\n<p><strong>Importance of Breadth-Based Learning:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Holistic Skill Development:</strong><br/>\r\nBreadth-based learning fosters the development of a wide range of skills, including critical thinking, creativity, problem-solving, and adaptability. By engaging with diverse subjects, students cultivate cognitive flexibility, enabling them to approach challenges from different angles and draw connections between seemingly unrelated concepts. This broad skill set is valuable in a rapidly changing world where versatility and adaptability are highly sought after.</p>\n<p><strong>Interdisciplinary Problem Solving:</strong><br/>\r\nMany of today's complex problems require interdisciplinary solutions. Breadth-based learning equips students with the ability to integrate knowledge from multiple disciplines and apply it to real-world scenarios. For instance, addressing climate change necessitates understanding scientific principles, economic implications, social behaviour, and policy-making. A breadth-based approach empowers students to tackle such multifaceted challenges more effectively.</p>\n<p><strong>Enhanced Creativity and Innovation:</strong><br/>\r\nBreadth-based learning encourages students to explore diverse artistic, scientific, and cultural fields, which enhances creativity and innovation. By exposing themselves to different perspectives, students develop a broader understanding of human experiences, leading to the synthesis of ideas and the generation of novel insights. Innovators like Steve Jobs, who drew inspiration from calligraphy and design principles, exemplify the power of cross-disciplinary thinking.</p>\n<p><strong>Research and Experts Supporting Breadth-Based Learning:</strong></p>\n<p><em>Richard Florida's Creative Class Theory:</em><br/>\r\nRichard Florida, an urban studies theorist, argues that a diverse and creative workforce drives economic growth and innovation. In his book \"The Rise of the Creative Class,\" Florida emphasizes the importance of interdisciplinary knowledge and cultural diversity in fostering economic development.</p>\n<p><em>Dr. Howard Gardner's Theory of Multiple Intelligences:</em><br/>\r\nDr. Howard Gardner's theory proposes that intelligence is not solely based on logical and linguistic abilities but encompasses multiple dimensions. His work suggests that individuals possess different cognitive strengths, and breadth-based learning allows students to discover and develop these diverse intelligences.</p>\n<p><em>The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine:</em><br/>\r\nIn their report, \"How People Learn II: Learners, Contexts, and Cultures,\" the National Academies emphasize the value of interdisciplinary education. They advocate for educational systems that provide students with opportunities to integrate knowledge and skills from various disciplines.</p>\n<p><strong>Why Breadth-Based Learning is Valuable:</strong><br/>\r\nBreadth-based learning, with its emphasis on interdisciplinary exploration, offers distinct advantages over alternatives. By encouraging students to engage with diverse subjects, breadth-based learning cultivates versatile skills, fosters creativity and innovation, and equips students to tackle complex problems that transcend traditional disciplinary boundaries. It prepares individuals for a dynamic and interconnected world, enabling them to adapt, synthesize knowledge, and make meaningful contributions across various domains.</p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong><br/>\r\nBreadth-based learning represents a shift away from the traditional specialization-focused education paradigm. By promoting interdisciplinary exploration and diverse knowledge acquisition, it equips students with valuable skills and perspectives necessary to thrive in the modern world. While depth-based learning and project-based learning have their merits, breadth-based learning offers a holistic educational experience that prepares individuals to navigate the complexities of a rapidly changing society. As we embrace breadth-based learning, we empower students to become lifelong learners, critical thinkers, and creative problem solvers capable of making a positive impact in their communities and beyond.</p>\n\n<p><strong>DEPTH-BASED LEARNING</strong></p>\n<p><br/>\r\nDepth-based learning is an educational approach that emphasizes in-depth exploration and specialization in a specific subject area or discipline. Rather than taking a broad and interdisciplinary approach, depth-based learning focuses on acquiring comprehensive knowledge, developing expertise, and honing specific skills within a specific domain.</p>\n<p>In depth-based learning, students delve deeply into a particular subject, dedicating significant time and effort to understanding its intricacies and complexities. This approach allows learners to develop a deep understanding of the subject matter, gain specialized knowledge, and acquire advanced skills that are specific to the chosen field.</p>\n<p><strong>Characteristics of Depth-Based Learning:</strong></p>\n<p>Specialization: Depth-based learning involves a concentrated focus on a specific field or subject area. Students engage in intensive study within their chosen domain, acquiring detailed knowledge and expertise.</p>\n<p>Comprehensive Understanding: The aim of depth-based learning is to develop a thorough and comprehensive understanding of the subject matter. Students explore the nuances, theories, methodologies, and applications within the chosen field, gaining a deep appreciation for its intricacies.</p>\n<p>Advanced Skills Development: In-depth study enables learners to acquire advanced skills that are specific to the chosen field. They develop specialized expertise, technical proficiency, and a deep understanding of the methodologies and tools used within the domain.</p>\n<p>Research and Analysis: Depth-based learning often involves conducting research and analysis within the specialized field. Students engage in critical analysis, evaluate existing theories and research, and contribute to the advancement of knowledge in their chosen discipline.</p>\n<p><strong>Benefits of Depth-Based Learning:</strong></p>\n<p>Expertise and Mastery: Depth-based learning allows individuals to become experts in their chosen field. By focusing on a specific subject, students can develop a high level of competence, mastery, and confidence in their area of specialization.</p>\n<p>Career Advancement: Specialized knowledge and expertise gained through depth-based learning can enhance career prospects. Employers often seek individuals with deep domain knowledge and specialized skills, making depth-based learning beneficial for career advancement.</p>\n<p>Contribution to Knowledge: Depth-based learning provides opportunities for students to engage in original research, contribute to their field's body of knowledge, and make meaningful contributions to advancements within their discipline.</p>\n<p>Intellectual Growth: In-depth study fosters intellectual growth by encouraging critical thinking, analytical reasoning, and a deeper understanding of complex concepts and theories. It promotes a deep appreciation for the intricacies and nuances within a specific field.</p>\n<p><strong>Examples of Depth-Based Learning:</strong></p>\n<p>Medical Specializations: Medical professionals undergo depth-based learning by specializing in areas such as cardiology, neurology, or oncology. They acquire extensive knowledge, develop specialized skills, and become experts in their chosen medical specialty.</p>\n<p>STEM Disciplines: Students pursuing degrees in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics often engage in depth-based learning within their chosen fields. For example, a physicist might specialize in quantum mechanics or a computer scientist might focus on artificial intelligence.</p>\n<p>Fine Arts: In disciplines such as painting, sculpture, or music, artists engage in depth-based learning to refine their techniques, develop a unique artistic style, and master their chosen medium.</p>\n<p><strong>Alternatives to Depth-Based Learning:</strong></p>\n<p>While depth-based learning offers numerous advantages, it may not be suitable for everyone or in every context. Alternatives that complement or balance depth-based learning include:</p>\n<p>Breadth-Based Learning: Breadth-based learning encourages students to explore multiple disciplines and gain knowledge across a wide range of subjects. It provides a holistic perspective and versatile skills that can be applied in various contexts.</p>\n<p>Project-Based Learning: Project-based learning focuses on hands-on experiences and real-world problem-solving.

    "introduction": "",
    "content": "<p>Just about every day I come across a new phrase or I have a \"ahaa!\" moment in my learning. Today both happened.</p>\n<p><strong>Rubber Duck Method</strong></p>\n<p>This was mentioned in our Slack group and I had no idea what it was so I looked it up. I grabbed this from Wikipedia</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In software engineering, <strong>rubber duck debugging</strong> (or <strong>rubberducking</strong>) is a method of debugging code by articulating a problem in spoken or written natural language. The name is a reference to a story in the book <em>The Pragmatic Programmer</em> in which a programmer would carry around a rubber duck and debug their code by forcing themselves to explain it, line by line, to the duck. Many other terms exist for this technique, often involving different (usually) inanimate objects, or pets such as a dog or a cat. </p>\r\nWikipedia</blockquote>\n<p>So, the idea is if I can explain what the code is meant to be doing to a rubber duck (or cat in my case) then chances are I will hit upon the issue that needs to be debugged.</p>\n<p>That is a brilliant idea. I am one step behind that though. After learning JavaScript for the last 4 weeks I think I will be happy if I could just read through the code and know what it meant!</p>\n<p>This is how I have been learning. I look at a piece of code and try to figure out what it means and why it has been put together the way it has in the hope that by doing that I will then know when to use it. That's my logic anyway.</p>\n<p>As an example:</p>\n<img src=\"https://todiane-dev.stackstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/function-math-i-0.png?w=731\"/>\n<p>I have been following videos to help me put together my code for my second project. Its a game. This works but what I need to do now is understand why it works, why it has been put together that way and why certain code has been used. Once I can do that I will then know when I can use it next time.</p>\n<p>So, I know this is a function()</p>\n<p>I understand the if / else statements</p>\n<p>I am also clear on the variable comChoice and if the computer chooses 1 the output is human, if it chooses 2 the output is plant, otherwise the output is soil.</p>\n<p>I understand that return will show the result.</p>\n<p>The part I am still getting to grips with is the</p>\n<p><em>for (let i = 0; i &lt; 1; i++) {<br/>\r\ncomChoice = Math.floor(Math.random() * 3) + 1;</em></p>\n<p>Still working on learning what all of that means.</p>\n<p><strong>My Ahaa Moment!</strong></p>\n<p>I am working on my second project and my mentor helped me turn a lot of if/and statements into an operation instead. So, I am working on a rock, paper, scissors game - only I have changed the name. I call it The Cycle of Life and use human, soil and plant as my options.</p>\n<p>So, here are the rules:</p>\n<img src=\"https://todiane-dev.stackstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/human-plant-soil-game-p2.png?w=1024\"/>\n<p>I had a lot of if / else statements that read if player choses human and computer choses plant then player wins because human beats plant.</p>\n<p>I had to go through and write statements for each one of them. If at any point I decided to add more to the game e.g. environment and animals, my code becomes a very long list of if / else statements - it all gets too busy.</p>\n<p>I recognised this but wasn't sure of a better way so my mentor explained one to me using conditionals and instead of a long list of statements it is nice and short:</p>\n<img alt=\"using conditionals javascript\" src=\"https://todiane-dev.stackstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/using-conditionals-javascript.png?w=1024\"/>\n<p>Now I can just add any new items in the const winOrder list with no issues.</p>\n<p>Plus I only needed three if statements - one for the winner, loser and if it was a draw. That will always stay the same.</p>\n<p><strong>Adding Options</strong></p>\n<p>I am still trying to decide whether I add another couple of options so it mimics rock, paper, scissors, lizard, spock!</p>\n<p>The Cycle of Life game, project two, is here:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://todiane.github.io/cycle-of-life-p2/\" target=\"_blank\">https://todiane.github.io/cycle-of-life-p2/</a></p>\n<p>It isn't due for submission until 10th August so I have time to add to it.</p>",

I will need basic programming knowledge and some NoSQL knowledge. However, the course itself will go through how to use MongoDB, Docker, and PyTest.  I won't need to know those two beforehand.</p>\n<figure><blockquote><p>This walkthrough shows how to set up a development environment, build a FastAPI backend, integrate MongoDB, define API endpoints, add chapter rating functionality, and compute aggregate course ratings. It covers fundamental project concepts as well as Python, MongoDB, and NoSQL databases.</p><cite>https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/fastapi-quickstart/</cite></blockquote></figure>\n<p>As far as my training goes, my list in order of importance is (so I can do more with WordPress)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Advanced CSS and HTML</li>\n<li>Resting APIs</li>\n<li>React</li>\n<li>PHP</li>\n<li>SQL / MSQL</li>\n<li>AI</li>\n</ul>\n<p>My list dictated by my Code Institute training is: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>HTML (Done)</li>\n<li>CSS (Done)</li>\n<li>JavaScript (Done)</li>\n<li>Python (Currently studying July/Aug 2023)</li>\n<li>Agile Development</li>\n<li>Bootstrap</li>\n<li>JQuery</li>\n<li>Intro to APIs</li>\n<li>Flask Framework</li>\n<li>Database Management</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I probably should have sat and considered what I want to gain from learning before starting the Full Stack course. If my goal is to stick with WordPress, then it covers very little of what I need. But my mind may change as I go through the course. I like the idea of being a Scrum Master. I might find that I prefer back-end over front-end. Who knows.</p>\n",

I completed enough of the Free Code Camp and Udemy courses to complete the project and I aim to go back and finish them because they were both very useful additions. I will use them when I move on to Python.</p>\n",

I was thinking about doing something similar with Google sheets API but couldn't think of a topic!</p>\n<p>Then I thought about survey data. Creating a program that looks at the data and creates charts for the user. After looking into it I was a little overwhelmed. Couldn't work out what the project would do or what it would look like. Found some great articles on using data with Python.</p>\n<p>For me on my full stack journey, I really want to create useful tools. So with that in mind I came up with a tool to help a fictitious company who uses contractors. The aim is to get the contractor to complete their details and the system will let them know how much they will be paid a week later.</p>\n<p><strong>I created a written plan</strong> (very old skool I know!) so I know what I want the project to do.

I let myself down on something that was quite simple and very annoying.</p>\n<p>As part of our course we have to validate our html using the w3c html validator. </p>\n<p>My project not only had an index page but also had  win, lose and thanks pages. </p>\n<p>When I created the three additional pages I made one and copied the code over. There were small errors that the html validator picked up, which I should have caught. The only thing is I forgot to run those pages through the validator. I ran the index page through it a few times but never considered those other three.</p>\n<p>The errors didn't stop the pages from working. They were things like a trailing / at the end of a URL and I had a &lt;div&gt; tag open with no closing &lt;/div&gt; tag. There were a couple more I can't recall now. They were small errors but errors nonetheless.</p>\n<p><strong>Why didn't I remember to run the other three pages through the html validator?</strong></p>\n<p>I think the main reason for this is having used WordPress for years you do something once and the other pages are automatically updated. So, in my head because I had run the index file through the other pages were covered. A silly mistake to make now I think about it.</p>\n<p>I  have made a similar error when creating websites. I find that when I go to create my navigation if I change something on the index.html page I forget that I then have to go through and change any other pages. </p>\n<p>I forget to do that sometimes because with WordPress if I change something on the main page navigation the other pages are automatically updated. So, I don't remember to update the other webpages until I notice that what I have changed on the index page isn't on one of the other pages. </p>\n<p>That reminds me to go through and update them all.</p>\n<p><strong>I am happy I passed.</strong> It is better than the alternative! </p>\n<p>But I worked hard on that project and had great feedback on my code and the layout, plus my <a href=\"https://github.com/todiane/cycle-of-life-p2\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">README file </a>was also praised. It is just a shame I missed out on a merit grade because of these silly errors. Every project MUST be submitted without errors. The rules are clear.</p>\n<p><strong>Updated Project</strong></p>\n<p>I have now gone through and corrected those errors. I was also told I needed more testing information and I updated that section in my README.</p>\n<p>My final grade will be dependent on the collective grade of all five of my projects and I have been told the assessor will visit once all five of my projects are complete. Hopefully I may get a few extra marks when they see that I have gone through and updated my project based on the feedback I received.</p>\n\n",

    "content": "\n<p>I have now completed and submitted my third full stack software developer training project. This project focuses on using Python.</p>\n<p>It is a portal for constructors to add their dates, number of days and hours into so they can get an idea of how much they will be paid.</p>\n<figure class=\"size-large\"><img src=\"https://todiane-dev.stackstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ccccp-storyboard-small.png?w=800\"/></figure>\n<p>After creating the main project my mentor encouraged me to add a Google Sheets API to the project so once the information is submitted the sheet is updated.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://corri-construction-8c4725a33281.herokuapp.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Here is the live project</a></p>\n<p>As this is Python the main form of PEP8 validation is done through my Codeanywhere IDE.</p>\n<p>I had to set up a Heroku account and deploy the project using Heroku, which I will upgrade to once my student credits run out.</p>\n<p><strong>How the project works</strong></p>\n<p>It starts by printing out the instructions for a contractor. I used a staggered typing effect to type them all out.</p>\n<pre><code>def type_print(text):\n    for character in text:\n        sys.stdout.write(character)\n        sys.stdout.flush()\n        time.sleep(0.05)\n    print('')</code></pre>\n<p>Then the user is asked  for their name and profession.</p>\n<p>They are then given an employee number (I used random.randit) which is just a random number and told their hourly rate.</p>\n<figure class=\"size-large is-resized\"><img src=\"https://todiane-dev.stackstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ccccp-rm-profession.png?w=1024\"/></figure>\n<p>The program moves on and asks them to add the dates, number of days and hours they worked.</p>\n<figure class=\"size-large\"><img src=\"https://todiane-dev.stackstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/cc-rm-check-information.png?w=1024\"/></figure>\n<p>This information is taken and the user is told how much their pay will be before and after tax and national insurance is deducted.</p>\n<p>They are asked to confirm the information is okay and they are happy to submit.</p>\n<figure class=\"size-large\"><img src=\"https://todiane-dev.stackstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/cc-rm-check-information-ok.png?w=1024\"/></figure>\n<p><strong>Finding Errors</strong></p>\n<p>I spent a lot of time making sure any potential errors a user could make were picked up because this is a major part of this project. The assessor will be looking for ways to \"break\" the site.</p>\n<p>I added my project into the \"peer review\" Slack channel I have access to and someone gave me an error I had missed. When I asked a yes or no question (y/n) if they put another letter in it wasn't picked up.</p>\n<p>First, I updated the instructions to say \"Use y or n only\" then I also added code so if they used another letter e.g. f - the system brings up an error asking them to only use y or n. They can only move on once one of those two letters are selected.</p>\n<p>Another important issue I picked up was in the input of first and last name. I accidently hit the return key and no name was entered but the system moved on. I realised I had to make first and last name a required field. I also added instructions asking for first name (Mark) and last name (Jenkins) - although mark jenkins and MARK JENKINS were also acceptable.</p>\n<p>Then I added code to ensure numbers and symbols could not be used, although if Elon Musk starts a trend and people name their children using numbers that may have to change in 18 years time!</p>\n<p><strong>Using Python</strong></p>\n<p>I actually enjoyed learning and using Python. It was a lot easier to use than JavaScript. Creating the code and understanding what I wanted it to do was easier for me because I felt as if I could just \"write out\" what I want to achieve in code.</p>\n<p>With JavaScript I feel there is a need to understand what JavaScript code does to make it to what you want but with Python I felt as if I knew what I wanted and I could get the code to do that for me - not sure if that makes any sense!</p>\n<p><strong>Onto Project 4</strong></p>\n<p>While I struggled to decided what project 3 was going to be about I am not having that issue with project 4. I already know that I want to create a social media type site. I will be creating the back-end and front-end. I will also have to ensure people have the ability to post, edit, cancel and delete information. Exciting times.</p>\n",

I celebrated the fact that there was no new code to learn and that Bootstrap is a framework that makes developing responsive websites easier.</p>\n<p>Although Bootstrap 5 is available the training focused on Bootstrap 4 and to complete the follow along project (a resume page) I had to use that version to ensure everything worked.</p>\n<p>Now, I am free to explore Bootstrap 5 although I may just focus my attention on React and using that as there are so many new things to learn.</p>\n<p>During the Bootstrap training I completed a simple landing page.

You can visit the channel for the full course content:</p>\n<p>00:07:04 Web Applications and the Request/Response Cycle<br/>00:13:07 Exploring the HyperText Transfer Protocol<br/>02:08:14 CSS - Cascading Style Sheets - (Part 1)<br/>03:41:53 How Databases Work<br/>04:00:49 Introduction to Structured Query Language (SQL)<br/>05:54:02 Using Templates in Django<br/>06:04:07 The Django Template Language (DTL)<br/>06:50:29 Forms, GET, POST, and HTTP<br/>06:58:48 Building HTML Forms<br/>08:05:51 Storing Primary and Foreign Keys in a Database<br/>09:49:30 Data Validation with Django Forms<br/>10:52:56 Owned Rows in Django - owner.py<br/>12:29:42 Building a Django Batch Script to Load Data from CSV<br/>13:10:31 JavaScript - The Language<br/>13:34:28 JavaScript Functions and Arrays<br/>14:57:07 jQuery and the Document Object Model<br/>15:09:44 Using jQuery<br/>16:24:40 Walking through the DJ4E JSON Sample Code<br/>16:30:41 Building an AJAX Chat with Django<br/>17:02:36 Walking through the DJ4E Social Login Code</p>\n<p>I watched the video in stages of two hours. After two hours I did something else like made something to eat, when for a walk, did nothing (had a nap!) and other small things for up to 30 minutes before returning. My longest gap is when I stopped to eat and then I had a couple of hours off after lunch and in the evening.</p>\n<p>I started watching Friday afternoon and went through until Sunday. I skipped some stuff at the beginning and anything else I felt I had covered and was okay with and only focused on anything I wanted to go over again or that was new to me.</p>\n",

I could not get the first project to work. I went through everything and got frustrated with it and hit delete. I started again, ended up frustrated and hit delete again. I may return to it but after two weeks of trying I decided to move on.</p>\n<p>My focus was very much on the second project because this is what I have wanted to create since I began my training - my own blog.</p>\n<p>Using Django, Bootstrap, Cloudinary and ElephantSQL I created a blog called SnarkVerse. A place to add posts that focus on sarcasm, irony, satire and paradox.</p>\n<p>I started and deleted this twice before managing to get it up on the third attempt and after contacting Tutor support for help.</p>\n<figure class=\"size-large\"><img src=\"https://todiane-dev.stackstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/snarkheader.png?w=1024\"/></figure>\n<p>You can read the<a href=\"https://github.com/todiane/blog-fsf\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> GitHub repo here</a></p>\n<p>The live blog is here</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://blog-fsf-1e72c6955bdf.herokuapp.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">SnarkVerse Blog</a></strong></p>\n<p>There was a final part that I left out which includes letting people add comments and likes to the blog post. They have to log in to leave comments and used an authentication mechanism.</p>\n<p>Authentication is an important part of Django (and Project 4) and I will of use learn how to use it and add it to my project but I didn't want to include it on this blog.</p>\n<p>In the future I may improve it so that people can not only comment but can add their own blog posts as well. Or it may need to become more of a social network to make that happen.</p>\n<p><strong>Admin Area</strong></p>\n<p>The admin area was set up and has a space for me to add new blog posts as well as edit and delete them. I can also add an image but right now I can't remove that image once it has been added.

I am pretty sure I have said that about JavaScript (still not a fan) and Python (I am learning to love it) but seriously, Django is its own nightmare.</p>\n<p>This link between model, view, template and url - getting it right so they all come together. The biggest shock for me is how the simple things, like wanting to add a link to delete comments, has caused me hours of frustration.</p>\n<p>I am spending 10-12 hours doing thing every day. This week it took a whole day to figure out how to add infinite scroll to a page (which has stopped working now). Another day or two to figure out adding the ability to add comments. My system for being able to follow users has been abandoned for now and I have a ton of error lines popping up as I code.</p>\n<p>Yesterday was a fun day as I spent it using Bootstrap and focused on the design and user experience. Another 10 hours doing that but my love of front-end made it easy to endure!</p>\n<p>Today I am back to trying to get my comment system to work. Codeanywhere has been a nightmare and is running slow so I switched to visual studio code. I am not familiar with VSC but won't do anything too difficult while I use it.</p>\n<p>I went on to YouTube to search for another help video when something came up in the results. An interview with Lawrence Lockhart @LawrenceDCodes</p>\n<figure class=\"is-type-video is-provider-youtube\"><div>\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zF3dYQGGLkM\n</div></figure>\n<p>Great information on imposter syndrome and how he views it.</p>\n<p>I love it when he said....</p>\n<p><em>\"When you want it as much as you want to breathe when you are underwater that is the point when things start clicking and you will go the extra mile\"</em></p>\n<p>There was also some great insights shared into how to learn code - not so much by following video tutorials but through reading documentation and building something yourself after watching a tutorial.</p>\n<p>Now, instead of finding a video I might see if I can look through the Django documentation and solve my issue with this comment box.</p>\n<p>Wish me luck.</p>\n",

Chatbots can be used for a wide range of applications, including customer service, sales, marketing, and even entertainment.</p>\n<p><strong>Chatbot developers</strong></p>\n<p>A chatbot developer is a web developer who creates, designs, tests, debugs and maintains chatbots using various tools and frameworks. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Common tools include frameworks like Botkit, Rasa and Dialogflow. </li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Testing and/or debugging tools like Postman, Chatbase</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>AI libraries or APIs like spaCy, TensorFlow, NLTK, Google Cloud Speech API.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Hosting on Heroku, Firebase, AWS</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It is important to understand natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML), as well as AI.</p>\n<p><strong>Learning about Chatbots</strong></p>\n<p>Before I go off and pay for the Global Tech Council - Certified Chatbot Expert course I am going to start with YouTube and then the Udemy Learn Chatbot Development in a Weekend (GPT, FastAPI, AWS) course. If I am still excited/interested I will then focus on gaining expert certification and building loads of Chatbots.</p>\n<figure class=\"is-type-video is-provider-youtube\"><div>\nhttps://youtu.be/pGOyw_M1mNE?si=opQ1_FSZV2W4IlFS \n</div></figure>\n<p>Hopefully following the route of YouTube (free), Udemy (low cost), Global Tech (higher cost) will give me an idea of whether this a path worth exploring.</p>\n",

You can ask simple questions like \"when is my next personal training session booked for\" or \"Call dad\" or \"what's the weather forecast today?\".</p>\n<p><strong>Strong AI</strong> is the theory of a machine having an intelligence equal to humans.

It includes two types of learning:</p>\n<p><strong><em>Unsupervised learning</em></strong> is the ability to find patterns or structure in data without our help. The more data we add the easier it becomes for the computer to see patterns that we may have missed. The computer may detect anomalies or cluster groups of similar data points together.</p>\n<p>Unsupervised learning can be used in retail to segment customers into distinct groups based on similarities in their demographics, behaviours, preferences, or purchasing patterns. This can help a business in personalising their promotional material and marketing strategies. It can also improve the customer experience by delivering specific offers and messages to a particular segment.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Supervised learning</em></strong> is where we label data and give general guidance. The AI model algorithm needs the correct answer to succeed. The performance of supervised learning algorithms is typically evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, Mean Squared Error (MSE), etc. <br/><br/>Using historical sales data, promotional activities, seasonality and other relevant factors supervised learning algorithms can forecast future sales based on this information. Supervised learning can be used to detect fraudulent activities like identity theft and payment fraud. By teaching the computer what is and what isn't an acceptable payment it can be taught to differentiate between what is and what is not acceptable.</p>\n<p><strong>Natural Language Processing</strong> (NLP - <em>not to be confused with Neuro Linguistic Programming, which I do all the time!</em>)</p>\n<p>NLP involves the development of algorithms and models to understand, interpret, and generate language. It can support a business with managing their unstructured data. It can include videos and audio as well as text data. Commonly used areas of NLP include</p>\n<p><strong><em>Text classification</em></strong> - organise your business documents into categories e.g. HR, company documentation, budget etc.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Information Extraction </em></strong>- Find important information buried in large amounts of data without having to read it all yourself. Extract the information you need quickly.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Conversational agents - question answering</em></strong><br/>The ability to community with a user using natural language. It is very common to visit a website that has a customer service agent that can answer questions for you or a chatbot. Nowadays you can order food and request refunds using these agents.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Sentiment Analysis </em></strong>- You can analysis the sentiment in free-form text like reviews for example. You can search out unhappy customers, people who leave a negative or neutral review. Anyone who expresses anger. It can also work to help you pull out positive reviews and reviews from customers that are happy.</p>\n<p>NLP fuelled by deep learning approaches have led to significant progress in tasks such as language translation, sentiment analysis, text summarization, and question answering.</p>\n<p><strong>Prompt Engineering</strong></p>\n<p>Prompt engineering is the area I am most interested in (at the time of writing this article). It focuses on our ability to craft effective prompts/instructions to guide an AI model like Chat GPT or Claude in providing the desired outcomes. The prompts created guide the behaviour of AI models by providing cues, constraints and context that will influence the information generated.</p>\n<p>What I have been able to learn so far is that this isn't a one time only process. Crafting prompts is an ongoing experiment, you have to be willing to create a prompt and then refine it based on the feedback provided. It becomes an iterative process as you explore strategies and best practices that will enhance the effectiveness of a prompt.</p>\n<p>As I learn to design prompts I will be helping to shape the behaviour of an AI system to align with specific goals, preferences and ethical considerations. This is what will support me in developing chatbots/virtual assistants based on the needs of a business or collective.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Chatbot / AI Virtual Assistants</em></strong></p>\n<p>My aim in learning about things like NLP and prompt engineering is to help me develop chatbots and AI virtual assistants.</p>\n<p>A chatbot (as mentioned above in conversational agents) is a program designed to simulate a conversation with a user. While they are popular in customer service there are also bots that provide guidance on a range of topics like fitness, recipes, books and more. You can ask a recipe chatbot to provide you with something to cook based on the ingredients in your cupboard, for example.</p>\n<p>AI virtual assistants are more advanced in their abilities. They perform perform a wider range of tasks and can often handle complex interactions, manage calendars, provide personalised recommendations, and integrate with various services and applications.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Deep Learning</em></strong></p>\n<p>Deep learning is another subset of machine learning that deals with algorithms inspired by the structure and function of the brain's neural networks. It is used in various domains such as computer vision, natural language processing, speech recognition, and more.</p>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em><strong>NOTE: The following explanations were created using Chat-GPT</strong> because I am not really focusing on them right now but may in the future:</em></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Computer Vision</strong>:\n<ul>\n<li>Computer vision focuses on enabling computers to gain high-level understanding from digital images or videos. Research in computer vision encompasses areas such as object detection, image classification, semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, and image generation, with applications ranging from autonomous vehicles to medical imaging.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Reinforcement Learning</strong>:\n<ul>\n<li>Reinforcement learning involves training agents to make sequential decisions through trial and error interactions with an environment. Research in reinforcement learning explores topics like policy optimization, exploration-exploitation trade-offs, value function approximation, and transfer learning, with applications in robotics, autonomous systems, and game playing.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Ethical AI and Responsible AI</strong>:\n<ul>\n<li>As AI technologies are increasingly integrated into various aspects of society, there is growing recognition of the importance of addressing ethical concerns, fairness, transparency, and accountability in AI systems. Research in ethical AI and responsible AI focuses on developing principles, guidelines, and frameworks to ensure that AI technologies benefit society while minimizing potential harms and biases.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Now that my full-stack developer training is complete my aim is to use what I know about Flask, Django, API and databases to build chatbots and AI virtual assistants.</p>\n<p>There is another way to go I discovered today. Rather than using all these tools I can use services like Microsoft Azure or the Google equivalent. Even IBM have a comprehensive learning package. I am still looking into exactly how I am going to put all this learning together.</p>\n",

They have a section for developers so I can build and pass them on to clients. I will be paying for all the work they have done to offer this service. This way, I save myself time with coding it all. There is also stack-ai.com, Botpress, Agentive with Voiceflow.</p>\n<p><strong>Learn Microsoft Azure.</strong> I spent more time working through the <a href=\"https://todiane.dev/2024/03/25/504/\">Microsoft AI Skills Challenge</a>. I wanted to learn how to use Azure for all things related to AI development. It seems everything I need is in one place.

    "content": "\n<p>I have heard over and over again that being a professional programmer involves more than just spending time watching coding videos. It is important to learn how to take code and break it down so you understand what it is doing.</p>\n<p>This video really goes into explaining how this works and has helped me to appreciate that figuring things out is a must. </p>\n<p>Having a strong foundation in whatever language you choose to learn is important because with a strong foundation in the basics you are not just copying and pasting code you actually learn how to craft solutions from scratch.</p>\n<figure class=\"is-type-video is-provider-youtube\"><div>\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SS19Q-_saCc\n</div></figure>\n<p>The video goes on to explain that the true challenge of programming lies in a programmer's mindset, problem solving and logical thinking. </p>\n<p>It's not just about knowing how to code it's about knowing what to code to develop a new feature or fix a bug. </p>\n<p>Being able to break code down into smaller manageable pieces then systematically addressing each part is an important skill to develop and it isn't a skill that can be taught. </p>\n<p>Getting better at this is where I need to take my Python skills next and it seems the best way to do that is to just keep building. Build something of my own. </p>\n<p>On my developer course we were always encouraged to figure things out on our own and I didn't appreciate what they were trying to do. I just saw it as not being supported in my learning. When you are new to coding being left to figure things out is frustratingly scary but necessary it seems.</p>\n<p>To get to this level takes practice and time. </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>\"...This is why people end up in a situation where they know all this theoretical knowledge but they have no practical knowledge they know everything but they don't know how to use it. It's one of those situations where you did too much tutorials and not enough things on your own and this is when people start entering tutorial hell and unfortunately they may never escape it. Tutorial hell is a place where endless tutorials are watched and countless examples are followed yet the ability to solve new or unique problems doesn't seem to improve. It's easy to fall into, this is why the learning curve in programming is notoriously steep because you need a balance of tutorials and doing things on your own. It's important to recognize that in order to escape tutorial hell it's not about abandoning tutorials altogether it's about how you use them. Tutorials are like training wheels eventually they're meant to be removed the real learning begins when you start applying what you've learned in different situations when you start cooking without the recipe so to speak...\"</em></p>\n<cite>The Coding Sloth</cite></blockquote>\n<p>His tips for getting into the programming mindset included:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Break down problems into smaller more manageable tasks. It can provide you with a clear starting point plus makes the problem manageable.</li>\n<li>Build your own projects. Project based learning is effective because you will solve problems as you build stuff.</li>\n<li>You can only truly say you understand something if you can explain it in simple terms to another person. So explain something to someone, or yourself. It will highlight what you know and where you need to study more.</li>\n<li>Embrace failure as a learning tool because it will help you understand where something went wrong. So start failing more. <strong>F</strong>irst <strong>A</strong>ttempt <strong>I</strong>s <strong>L</strong>earning (FAIL)</li>\n<li>Practice regularly for an hour or more every day.</li>\n<li>Stop comparing yourself to other people. Just focus on where you are at and how far you have come. Celebrate the bug you solved or the tutorial you completed or the error you made (see number 4).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This video ended up in my YouTube recommendations list and I am so happy I took the time to watch it because right now, as I take off my training wheels, I know where my focus needs to be.</p>\n<p>Here is another video with the same message. It seems the universe really wants me to get this message. Just write and build. Accept your mistakes. Deal with the coding programs. Build and solve problems.</p>\n<figure class=\"is-type-video is-provider-youtube\"><div>\nhttps://youtu.be/QMbx0dTWJIQ?si=Ae9Rzc2nWnq8eK8m\n</div></figure>\n",

    "content": "\n<p>Having worked with WordPress for so long I have muscle memory around setting up a new site. It took minutes. For the past week I have dedicated my time to developing muscle memory with Django and Wagtail. 😊<br/><br/>Using CMD to set up and activate virtual environments, creating a project folder, installing Wagtail (or Django), installing dependencies, migrating to create the database, creating a superuser and starting the server. Finally, deploying the project to GitHub and then opening it up in VSC to start building the site.  🎊<br/><br/>I can't believe back in June when I first met Django it took several hours just to install it and I had never heard of or used a virtual environment.<br/><br/>Now its up in under 10 minutes. Practice really does make progress! 🚀 💃<br/><br/>Next, I am creating my main business website using Wagtail and the serious work of product development, building bespoke sites and developing AI Assistants can begin.<br/><br/>What I lack in years of experience with Django and Wagtail will be made up for in my depth of learning and project creation. I love them both right now 😍</p>\n<p>I prefer to go through text rather than videos (sometimes) when it comes to learning so I have written down the process for myself.</p>\n<p><strong>Installing Wagtail</strong></p>\n<p>I already have python and pip installed on my Windows computer. I can open the command prompt and type</p>\n<pre><code><strong>python --version or pip --version</strong> </code></pre>\n<p>to discover which version of them I have, right now it is version 3.10. </p>\n<p>To create a directory folder I type:</p>\n<pre><code>mkdir DIRECTORY NAME  - ( e.g. packages )</code></pre>\n<p>To go into the folder just created use cd</p>\n<pre><code>cd packages</code></pre>\n<p>Next, set up a virtual environment</p>\n<pre><code>py -m venv FOLDER NAME </code></pre>\n<p><em>e.g. env or venv or .venv</em> - I have started using the same folder name - <em>env</em></p>\n<p>Then activate the environment using</p>\n<pre><code>env/Scripts/activate (env/bin/activate on Mac)</code></pre>\n<p>now you are in your virtual environment (make sure you see (env)…. )</p>\n<p><strong>Next, install Wagtail</strong></p>\n<pre><code>pip install wagtail </code></pre>\n<p>Use pip install wagtail ==5.1.0 to install a specific version. I tend to stick with the latest version.</p>\n<p>If you get a message show up in yellow saying your pip version is old you can upgrade pip. The message will tell you have to do that and it is usually </p>\n<pre><code>python.exe -m pip install --upgrade pip</code></pre>\n<p>Using</p>\n<pre><code>pip show wagtail </code></pre>\n<p>will show the details of what you have installed.</p>\n<p><strong>Now we can start a new wagtail project</strong></p>\n<pre><code>wagtail start NAME_OF_PROJECT . <em><strong>(that fullstop is important) </strong></em></code></pre>\n<p>- folders will be created with this name so chose carefully</p>\n<p><strong><em>e.g. wagtail start packages . </em></strong></p>\n<p>I have gotten into the habit of calling the first folder and my project the same name but they can be different. </p>\n<p>Then install all the required files</p>\n<pre><code>pip install -r requirements.txt </code></pre>\n<p>Set up the database and schemas needed to run wagtail</p>\n<pre><code>python manage.py migrate</code></pre>\n<p>Type <em><strong>manage.py run server</strong></em> and click on the server link http://127.0.0.1:8000</p>\n<p>This takes you to the default Wagtail page and your site is up</p>\n<figure class=\"size-medium\"><img src=\"https://todiane-dev.stackstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/wagtail-cms-homepage-dangify.png?w=300\"/></figure>\n<p>Using ctrl + c will let you quit the server</p>\n<p><strong>Next step is to create a SUPERUSER</strong></p>\n<pre><code>python manage.py createsuperuser</code></pre>\n<ul>\n<li>username</li>\n<li>email address</li>\n<li>password then confirm password.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once successful you can go to link <strong>http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin</strong> and log into the admin area.</p>\n<p><strong>That's it. Wagtail is up and running.</strong></p>\n<p>Then open up visual studio code. Select open folder and open the new project folder you just created.</p>\n<p>Activate your virtual environment and you are good to go.</p>\n\n<p>To deactivate your virtual environment at any time you can<strong> just type deactivate</strong> in the terminal and the (env) will disappear and you will be in your project.</p>\n<p>After this I then set the project up at <a href=\"https://github.com/todiane\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub</a> and connect GitHub with the project in visual studio code.</p>\n",

It can also be used for one organisation who has many different sub-pages they need to keep. Or a news site that has different sites and they want to share the same article on more than one site.</p>\n<p><strong>Getting started with multi-site</strong></p>\n<p>I went searching for a tutorial or helpful information on how to create a Wagtail multisite and struggled. There was an article on Wagtail.org that was written in 2016 with a site on GitHub - but very little else.</p>\n<p>I was a little annoyed because I had no way of knowing how to do this myself. That's when it hit me. <strong>All of my learning has come from following videos. </strong>I have never had to sit and work out how to build something myself.</p>\n<p>Luckily, with the help of ChatGPT, I didn't have to figure it out all by myself. I started using Co-Pilot and Chat but the Co-Pilot results were so poor I stopped using it.</p>\n<p><strong>My multi-site on GitHub</strong></p>\n<p>I am going to add the multisite that I have built on to GitHub and then type up everything I did, to the best of my ability, because it was a lot.</p>\n<p>I could just upload what I have to GitHub today but I prefer to add commits as I go along so I can read back over what I have worked on. If I add it now I will be adding the complete site. </p>\n<p>So, despite not really wanting to, I am going to start again. Add the multisite to GitHub right at the start and add commits as I go, then I will write it all up in my README. </p>\n<p>Just like my training taught me to :) </p>\n\n",

    "content": "\n<p>I have set up Wagtail CMS Multi-site and I wanted to document what I have done so far, just in case I decide to do this again.</p>\n<p>I set up a new installation and added it to GitHub. I used ChatGPT to help me write code when I knew it would save me time and to help me start the process.</p>\n<p>ChatGPT Prompt:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"You are an expert Django and Wagtail CMS Multi-site tutor specialised in teaching the basics of creating Wagtail Multi-sites, focusing on set up and development procedures, databases, and data structures. You provide clear, concise explanations and practical examples, using images and/or code to illustrate complex concepts. You are beginner-friendly, maintaining a conversational and simplified tone.  Write a full essay of 2,000 words or more on how to set up a wagtail multi-site project. Give exact step by step procedure.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Despite asking for step by step instructions a couple of major things were missed that I picked up on later but this was a good way to start.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Edited Prompt:</em></strong></p>\n<p>Now that this is complete this is what I would have added to my original prompt for more accuracy:<br/><br/><em>I am using Windows 11</em></p>\n<p>Although I have been using ChatPGT for months now and it knows that based on the number of questions I have asked!</p>\n<p><strong>Quick Side Track</strong></p>\n<p>As well as Wagtail multi-site there is an opportunity to use <strong><a href=\"https://todiane.dev/2024/06/08/wagtail-multisite/\">Django multi-tenant</a></strong>. As this is a project created for me to host all my websites in one place I went with multi-site.</p>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center has-x-large-font-size\"><strong>Getting Started</strong></p>\n<h2>Setting Up the Environment</h2>\n<p>I was given a list of the necessary tools to get started:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Python</strong>: Ensure Python 3.8+ is installed.</li>\n<li><strong>Pip</strong>: Python's package installer.</li>\n<li><strong>Virtualenv</strong>: To create isolated Python environments.</li>\n<li><strong>PostgreSQL</strong>: Recommended database for Wagtail.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As I have Windows I use my command line prompt (CMD) to complete setup. I set up a virtual environment, install Wagtail, start a project, make migrations then set up a super user. </p>\n<p>Once complete I open the project in Visual Studio Code to get started.</p>\n<p><strong>Install Virtualenv</strong>:</p>\n<ol>\n<li></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Here's the complete list. Add the command:</p>\n<pre><code>pip install virtualenv\n\nmkdir &lt;project_name&gt; - e.g. <code>'<span>packages'</span></code>\ncd packages\n\nvirtualenv venv\n\nvenv\\Scripts\\activate\n</code></pre>\n<p>Start with pip install virtualenv, then make a new directory using mkdir and give your project a name. I will use the name packages to use as an example.</p>\n<p>Next change directories (cd) so you are in that folder e.g. cd packages</p>\n<p>Once in the packages folder type virtualenv venv - venv is the industry standard name given to virtual environments but you can call it anything you want. Sometimes I just use env.</p>\n<p>Finally, activate the virtual environment using venv\\Scripts\\activate.</p>\n<p><strong>Activation error</strong></p>\n<p>The very first error from ChatGPT was the instructions to activate the virtual environment. I didn't specify in my prompt that I was using Windows 11, which I should have so it gave me source venv/bin/activate - which caused an error. Luckily, I have set up environments before so I knew what was needed.</p>\n<p>The image below shows the virtual environment setup.</p>\n<figure class=\"size-large\"><img alt=\"windows virtual environment setup\" src=\"https://todiane-dev.stackstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/1windows-virtual-environment-setup.png?w=1024\"/></figure>\n<p>you will know you are in your virtual environment because you will see the name you gave it in brackets (venv)</p>\n<p>Once you log into visual studio code you can then activate your virtual environment in there before you start work. The image below is me activating the multi-site I eventually set up:</p>\n<figure class=\"size-large\"><img src=\"https://todiane-dev.stackstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/activate-virtual-environment-vsc.png?w=1024\"/></figure>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>I have set up Wagtail CMS, Django and virtual environments a few times now so the next part is all me :) </em> </p>\n<p>I tend to stick to the same routine.</p>\n<h2>Install Wagtail CMS</h2>\n<pre><code>pip install wagtail</code></pre>\n<p>A simple instruction added to the cmd that installs the latest version of Wagtail CMS. You can install an older version if you want to by specifying the version e.g. pip install wagtail==5.1.0</p>\n<figure class=\"size-large\"><img src=\"https://todiane-dev.stackstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/install-wagtail-pip-install-wagtail.png?w=1024\"/></figure>\n<p><strong>Create a Project</strong></p>\n<p>Now create a new project inside the project folder. As I called my original folder packages I will call my project that too. I tend to call my project whatever I have called my folder. That's just me. You can name the project whatever you like.</p>\n<p>The instruction is</p>\n<pre><code>wagtail start &lt;project name&gt;</code></pre>\n<figure class=\"size-large\"><img alt=\"install wagtail cms using wagtail start then project name\" src=\"https://todiane-dev.stackstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/wagtail-cms-start-project.png?w=1024\"/></figure>\n<p><strong>Migrate the project</strong></p>\n<p>So now I have Wagtail CMS installed and a new project I activate/set up a new database for my project by running the instruction:</p>\n<pre><code>python manage.py migrate</code></pre>\n<figure class=\"size-large\"><img alt=\"migrate wagtail cms using python manage.py migrate\" src=\"https://todiane-dev.stackstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/python-manage.py-migrate.png?w=1024\"/></figure>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center has-large-font-size\"><strong>Wagtail CMS is now LIVE!</strong></p>\n<p>You can use the command</p>\n<pre><code>python manage.py runserver</code></pre>\n<p>to visit the new site. I always do just to check it is there. </p>\n<figure class=\"size-large\"><img src=\"https://todiane-dev.stackstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/python-manage-runserver.png?w=747\"/></figure>\n<p>When you click on the link: 127.0.0.1:8000 you will see your brand new site</p>\n<figure class=\"size-large\"><img src=\"https://todiane-dev.stackstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/1new-wagtail-site-created.png?w=1024\"/></figure>\n<p>You won't be able to log in though until you create your first user known as a superuser.</p>\n<p>Use CTRL-C to break the connection and continue...</p>\n<p><strong>Create a Super User</strong></p>\n<p>Next you will need to create the main administrator of the site called a super user:</p>\n<pre><code>python manage.py createsuperuser</code></pre>\n<p>First add a username - I used admin here in this example but I never use admin. I always come up with a proper username. Then add an email address and password. </p>\n<p>NOTE: The cursor does not move as you type your password!</p>\n<figure class=\"size-large\"><img src=\"https://todiane-dev.stackstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/python-manage-createsuperuser.png?w=1024\"/></figure>\n\n<h2>Update Settings</h2>\n<p>At this point I open Visual Studio Code, activate my virtual environment and make some changes to the settings file.</p>\n<figure class=\"size-large\"><img alt=\"activate venv\" src=\"https://todiane-dev.stackstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/activate-venv.png?w=1024\"/></figure>\n<p>Django just has one file called settings.py but wagtail has three separate ones and the main one is base.py</p>\n<figure class=\"size-large\"><img alt=\"wagtail cms settings base.py\" src=\"https://todiane-dev.stackstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/wagtail-settings-basepy-1.png?w=630\"/></figure>\n<p>Open base.py and add the following (I add them at the top but some people prefer to add anything new to the bottom)</p>\n<pre><code>DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD = 'django.db.models.BigAutoField'\n\n\nSITE_ID = 1\n\n\nALLOWED_HOSTS = \n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Default Auto Field</strong></p>\n<p>Configure the DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD setting in your Django settings file (BASE.py) to specify the default primary key type for all models. It is considered  good practice to specify the primary key type explicitly to avoid any potential issues in the future.<br/><br/>DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD = 'django.db.models.BigAutoField'</p>\n<p><strong>Site ID</strong></p>\n<p>\"The SITE_ID setting <strong>specifies the database ID of the Site object associated with that particular settings file</strong>.\" - taken from the Django Documentation.</p>\n<p><strong>Allowed Hosts</strong></p>\n<p>Sometimes your browser may throw an error and not let you see the site. It will let you know you need to add the site name to your settings. You need ALLOWED_HOSTS for that reason. Start with localhost and once you set your sites up add them as well.</p>\n<p><strong>Include Wagtail Contrib Settings</strong></p>\n<p>ChatGPT did not include this in the instructions. In fact all it said was install wagtail and log in. No other instructions. Luckily for me I figured it out after hours of research and video watching.</p>\n<pre><code>\"wagtail.contrib.settings\",</code></pre>\n<p>You need to add this to your INSTALLED APPS section</p>\n<p>The <code>'wagtail.contrib.settings'</code>, module is an optional Wagtail package that provides an interface for managing site-specific settings directly from the Wagtail admin. </p>\n<p>This is useful in a multisite setup where different sites might need distinct configurations. This includes configurations like social media links, analytics codes, or any custom settings that might vary between sites.</p>\n<p>I did update the quotes to be double like the others later...</p>\n<figure class=\"size-large\"><img alt=\"wagtail contrib settings\" src=\"https://todiane-dev.stackstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/wagtail-contrib-settings-1.png?w=1024\"/></figure>\n<p><strong>Add Django Contrib Sites</strong></p>\n<p>Another important item you need in your settings file. ChatGPT missed it out and when I told it this is what it said</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You're right; including <code>'django.contrib.sites'</code> in your <code>INSTALLED_APPS</code> is crucial for managing multiple sites in Django and Wagtail. The <code>django.contrib.sites</code> framework is an essential part of Django's site management, especially in a multisite setup, as it allows you to associate objects (like models and settings) with specific sites.</p>\n<h3 class=\"has-medium-font-size\">Why <code>'django.contrib.sites'</code> is Necessary</h3>\n<p>The <code>django.contrib.sites</code> framework helps you manage content for multiple sites from a single Django project. It provides the <code>Site</code> model, which stores domain names and site-specific settings.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<pre><code>Add it to your settings:\n\n\"django.contrib.sites\",</code></pre>\n<figure class=\"size-large\"><img src=\"https://todiane-dev.stackstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/django-contrib-sites.png?w=1024\"/></figure>\n<p>Once you have saved the file you need to migrate the database.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Migrate Database</strong>: Run the migrations to create the necessary database tables for the <code>Site</code> model.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Including <code>'django.contrib.sites'</code> in your <code>INSTALLED_APPS</code> is essential for effectively managing multiple sites within a single Django and Wagtail project. This framework allows you to differentiate content and settings between sites, making your multisite setup robust and manageable. Ensure that you have added this configuration to take full advantage of Wagtail's multisite capabilities.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Wagtail Contrib Settings</strong></p>\n<p>Next include the <code>'wagtail.contrib.settings.context_processors.settings'</code> context processor. It needs to be added under the TEMPLATES section in the base.py settings file.</p>\n<figure class=\"size-large\"><img alt=\"wagtail contrib settings\" src=\"https://todiane-dev.stackstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/wagtail-contrib-context-processors.png?w=1024\"/></figure>\n<p>This will make the custom Wagtail settings easily accessible in the templates. This context processor automatically adds the settings to the template context, so you can use them directly without needing to load them manually.</p>\n\n<h2>Amend URLS.py </h2>\n<p>I knew I needed to change the structure of the URLS based on the old multisite setup instructions I found from 2016 along with an article from Wagtail.</p>\n<p>So I asked ChatGPT about it. The instructions it gave me where not what I expected. After some research I asked it about adding r'^' to urls.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The <code>r'^'</code> in the URL patterns specifies that the string should be treated as a raw string, and the <code>^</code> indicates the beginning of the URL path. This is used to match and include specific sets of URL patterns based on the initial segments of the URL.</p>\n<p>Yes, if you're using Wagtail in a multisite setup, you would typically include these URL patterns in your main project's URL configuration, regardless of whether you're using a single-site or multisite configuration.</p>\n<p>So, yes, you should include these URL patterns in your main project's URL configuration, regardless of whether you're using Wagtail in a single-site or multisite setup. This ensures that the Wagtail admin interface and document management system are accessible and functional across all sites within your Wagtail project.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Sure, let's update the <code>urls.py</code> to include your existing URLs while ensuring the configurations needed for the multisite setup are properly incorporated.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<figure class=\"size-large\"><img src=\"https://todiane-dev.stackstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/change-urls-wagtail-file.png?w=1003\"/></figure>\n<p>ChatGPT missed out many of the instructions I needed. It also provided incorrect instructions on a number of occasions. This is why it is important to have some idea of what you are doing before accepting code.</p>\n<p><strong>What's Next?</strong></p>\n<p>That is everything for this first stage. Wagtail CMS multi-site has been set up and the settings needed along with the correct urls structure has been added.</p>\n<p>Next, I had to create my models by adding code to the models.py file and to the template. I only started with the homepage.</p>\n<p>After that I logged into the admin area to create a few sites.</p>\n<p>I will add that in another blog post.</p>\n",

    "content": "\n<p>I took some time off. It's been nice but now I need to get back to coding. It is too easy to forget everything when you stay away for a while.</p>\n<p>I managed to get back into my fitness routine (a little). I am currently experimenting with a new way of eating (Carnivore). This means I have even more time to sit and code. Eating just steak and eggs twice a day really does leave you plenty of time for other things!</p>\n<p>I put up and took down a few <a href=\"https://todiane.dev/category/wagtail/\">Wagtail sites</a>. When I hit an error and couldn't fix it I decided to leave Wagtail alone for a while. The trouble with coding on your own is when you hit a snag that isn't easy to fix. There isn't anywhere to go for help. I do love having to fix bugs and work out what is wrong, but sometimes I end up beaten.</p>\n<p><strong>Back To WordPress</strong></p>\n<p>I set up a new blog on wordpress.com to help me promote my <a href=\"https://penandipublishing.com\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">paperback notebooks</a>. I love that I get a monthly income from this business, but it's small. I just want to continue to write content and stories plus create new notebooks. There is nothing difficult about this at all, which is why I love it.</p>\n<p>Because I have been away from WordPress for a few years I bought a couple of Udemy courses that are up to date and focus on being a developer. It will help me get used to the new WordPress. </p>\n<p>It also includes information on creating themes and plugins. Now that I have coding/developer skills I feel more confident about creating them.</p>\n<p><strong>Back To AI</strong></p>\n<p>Along with WordPress my focus is back on AI and what I can build. I have a domain called inspirationalguidance.com, it will be 21 years old in 2025 - I would love to build something on it. Right now it just forwards to my notebook business but creating something personal development related would be great.</p>\n<p>In the past it focused on confidence building and setting goals. I still find setting intentions is the best way for me to get anything done so I may set up a site using AI that will support people with setting and managing their intentions or habits.</p>\n<p><strong>Flippa.com</strong></p>\n<p>Rather than build something myself I am also looking into what's available to buy. At least that way I can focus on managing it rather than creating it.</p>\n<p>If I do buy something it has to be created using software I already know because I don't think I want to have to learn something new. WordPress sites for sale is fairly popular on Flippa. Anything using Flask or Django would be great but I haven't come across anything yet. Next.js is also a possibility although I still need to learn more.</p>\n<p>Today I was looking at a Relationship Coaching directory for sale. Relationship Life Coaches sign up and pay a monthly fee. It has been created using WordPress and seemed like a good fit for my domain. Then I thought about whether I want to focus on a passive income model that includes having to find and manage business owners. As I have done that in the past I decided against it!!!!</p>\n<p>For me, passive income is all about enjoying a business that sells to consumers. Like drop shipping or selling paperback notebooks using a print on demand system or selling downloadable art/ebooks/products.</p>\n",

    "content": "\n<p>As I have been away from Python for a couple of months I am getting reacquainted with how it works. Understanding and mastering Python involves understanding several foundational concepts. Once you learn the basics everything else will fall into place.</p>\n<p>Learning Python using copy and paste isn't really helpful (as I have discovered via my own experience). For example, if you don't understand how to define and call a function, you won't understand why what you are building is not doing what you want it to do. I don't know how many times I created a function but didn't call it before I learnt that lesson. It is like asking someone to do something for you, but never telling them what it is you want them to do. Until you tell them what to do, it won't get done.</p>\n<p>So knowing some basic python concepts is really important and here's a list of the basics I learnt and continually go over to make sure I don't forget:</p>\n<p>Basic Syntax and Variables</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Syntax</strong>: Learn the basic structure of Python code, including indentation and comments.</li>\n<li><strong>Variables</strong>: Understand how to declare and use variables to store data.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Data Types and Structures</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Primitive Data Types</strong>: Integers, floats, strings, and booleans.</li>\n<li><strong>Data Structures</strong>: Lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Control Flow</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Conditional Statements</strong>: <code>if</code>, <code>elif</code>, and <code>else</code> statements.</li>\n<li><strong>Loops</strong>: <code>for</code> and <code>while</code> loops for iteration.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Functions</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Defining Functions</strong>: How to create and call functions.</li>\n<li><strong>Parameters and Return Values</strong>: Passing data to functions and getting results back.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Modules and Packages</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Importing Modules</strong>: Using built-in and third-party modules.</li>\n<li><strong>Creating Packages</strong>: Organizing code into reusable packages.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>File Handling</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Reading and Writing Files</strong>: Opening, reading, writing, and closing files.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Error Handling</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Exceptions</strong>: Using <code>try</code>, <code>except</code>, <code>finally</code>, and <code>raise</code> to handle errors.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Classes and Objects</strong>: Creating and using classes and objects.</li>\n<li><strong>Inheritance and Polymorphism</strong>: Extending classes and using polymorphism.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Libraries and Frameworks</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Standard Library</strong>: Familiarize yourself with Python's extensive standard library.</li>\n<li><strong>Popular Libraries</strong>: Learn to use libraries like NumPy, pandas, and requests.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Advanced Topics</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Decorators</strong>: Understanding and using decorators.</li>\n<li><strong>Generators</strong>: Creating and using generators for efficient looping.</li>\n<li><strong>Context Managers</strong>: Using <code>with</code> statements for resource management.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Testing and Debugging</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Unit Testing</strong>: Writing tests using frameworks like <code>unittest</code> or <code>pytest</code>.</li>\n<li><strong>Debugging</strong>: Using tools like <code>pdb</code> to debug code.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Version Control</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Git</strong>: Using Git for version control and collaboration.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Web Development (Optional)</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Frameworks</strong>: Learning frameworks like Django or Flask for web development.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Data Science and Machine Learning (Optional)</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Libraries</strong>: Using libraries like scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I joined DataCamp so I can learn about python libraries like TensorFlow and PyTorch. It is also helping me with my AI learning. There is a great course called building chatbots in Python.</p>\n<p>These concepts will give a solid foundation for mastering Python. I still struggle with some concepts like testing and debugging. Also, I find if I step away from Python for a while I have to go back and relearn some of it. As with any language, if you don't use it, you lose it.</p>\n<p>Python will play a huge part in the AI chatbots and assistants that I develop. While I can use no code or low code options, knowing Python will help me build more advanced structures. Plus I will have a better understand of how to fix the code should anything go wrong.</p>\n",

    "introduction": null,
    "content": "\n<p>SEO (Search Engine Optimisation) is a critical part of any website. When I install a WordPress website, there are a few things I do. I make sure that the site I hand over is optimised for the business.</p>\n<p>When it comes to learning about anything in the world of digital marketing, I find it easier to explain it in concrete terms. I also find it easier to learn in concrete terms too!</p>\n<p>So, here's the type of conversation I have with someone interested in search engine optimisation for their business website.</p>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>TECHNICAL SEARCH ENGINE OPTIMISATION (SEO)</strong></p>\n<hr class=\"has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<p><strong>Jamie</strong>:  I’ve been hearing a lot about SEO lately, especially \"technical SEO.\" I know it's important for websites, but I don't really get what it all means. Can you explain it to me?</p>\n<p><strong>Me</strong>: Of course! Imagine your website is like a house. You’ve got the beautiful design, furniture, and decorations—that’s your content, images, and all the fun stuff users see. But then you have things like the plumbing, wiring, and foundation—the stuff that keeps everything working properly, but people don’t really see it. <strong><em>That’s technical SEO</em></strong>. <strong>It’s all about how your site works behind the scenes to make sure it’s easy for both users and search engines to find, use, and understand your website.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Jamie</strong>: Oh, I get it! So it's like making sure the house doesn’t have leaks or faulty wiring?</p>\n<p><strong>Me</strong>: Exactly! You want everything to run smoothly. The goal of technical SEO is to <strong>help search engines—like Google, Bing, or Yahoo—easily \"crawl\" or explore your site</strong>, understand what it's about, and index it properly so that people searching for relevant topics can actually find it.</p>\n<p><strong>Jamie</strong>: Okay, but how do search engines \"crawl\" a site? That sounds kind of weird.</p>\n<p><strong>Me</strong>:<strong> Crawling is just a fancy way of saying that search engines send out robots, or “bots,” to go through your site’s pages</strong>. They check out what’s there, follow the links, and make a note of everything. But you have to make sure those bots can actually find everything! That's where crawlability comes in.</p>\n<p><strong>Jamie</strong>: So, what do you do to make sure your site is crawlable?</p>\n<p><strong>Me</strong>: Well, first, you want to make sure you have an <strong>XML sitemap</strong>. This is like a roadmap for search engines, showing them all the important pages on your site. Then there's the <strong>robots.txt file</strong>—this file tells the bots which pages they should or shouldn’t crawl. For instance, you might not want them crawling admin pages or sensitive info.</p>\n<p><strong>Jamie</strong>: Ah, so it’s like giving them directions on where they’re allowed to go?</p>\n<p><strong>Me</strong>: Exactly! And if you have multiple versions of a page—like one for mobile and one for desktop—you can use something called <strong>canonical tags</strong> to tell the bots which version is the “main” or most important one. That way, you avoid confusing the bots and getting penalised for duplicate content.</p>\n<p><strong>Jamie</strong>: Got it! So what else should I worry about? Is it just making sure bots can crawl everything?</p>\n<p><strong>Me</strong>: Oh, there’s a lot more! Next up is your <strong>site architecture</strong>—basically how your site is structured. Think of it like organising a filing cabinet. You want everything easy to find, both for your users and the search engines. A <strong>clean URL structure</strong> is a big part of that. Instead of a URL that looks like a jumble of numbers and symbols, you want something like “yourwebsite.com/blog/how-to-start.” It's clear and tells both users and search engines exactly what the page is about.</p>\n<p><strong>Jamie</strong>: That makes sense. What about mobile? Everyone’s on their phone these days.</p>\n<p><strong>Me</strong>: Mobile-friendliness is HUGE now. Google even does <strong>mobile-first indexing</strong>, meaning they prioritize how your site performs on mobile when determining rankings. So your site needs to be <strong>responsive</strong>—meaning it adjusts to different screen sizes—and it needs to load quickly on mobile devices.</p>\n<p><strong>Jamie</strong>: Right, no one likes waiting for a page to load. Speaking of that, is speed really that important for SEO?</p>\n<p><strong>Me</strong>: Definitely. <strong>Page speed</strong> is crucial. If your site takes forever to load, people bounce off, and that sends a bad signal to search engines. They think, \"Well, if people aren’t staying on this site, it must not be that valuable.\" Tools like <strong>Google PageSpeed Insights</strong> can help you figure out where your site might be slowing down.</p>\n<p><strong>Jamie</strong>: So, how do you speed things up?</p>\n<p><strong>Me</strong>: There are lots of ways! First, you can <strong>optimise images</strong>—big image files are often the culprit when it comes to slow loading times. You can also <strong>minify</strong> your JavaScript and CSS files, which just means removing unnecessary code to make them faster. Plus, using <strong>browser caching</strong> and a <strong>Content Delivery Network (CDN)</strong> can help reduce load times for users all around the world.</p>\n<p><strong>Jamie</strong>: That sounds like a lot of technical work! Anything else I should worry about?</p>\n<p><strong>Me</strong>: Yeah, one thing you can’t ignore is security. Using <strong>HTTPS</strong> instead of HTTP ensures your site is secure, and search engines favour secure sites in the rankings. Plus, it builds trust with your users.</p>\n<p><strong>Jamie</strong>: Oh yeah, I’ve seen that little padlock icon in the browser bar before. So that’s related to SEO?</p>\n<p><strong>Me</strong>: Yep, it’s a small ranking factor, but it also improves user experience and trust, which matters a lot. Plus, if you mix secure content (HTTPS) with insecure content (HTTP), that can cause problems. It’s called <strong>mixed content</strong>, and it can affect both your rankings and the user experience.</p>\n<p><strong>Jamie</strong>: Wow, I didn’t realise how deep this all goes. What’s this <strong>structured data</strong> I’ve heard about?</p>\n<p><strong>Me</strong>:  <strong>Structured data</strong> is like giving search engines extra context about your content. It’s a way of “marking up” your pages so that search engines can display richer information in search results—like product reviews, FAQs, event dates, or recipes. This can make your site stand out more in the SERPs with <strong>rich snippets</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Jamie</strong>: So that’s how some results show star ratings or specific details right in the search results?</p>\n<p><strong>Me</strong>: Exactly! It’s all about using something called <strong>schema markup</strong> to help the bots understand the content better and display it in more engaging ways.</p>\n<p><strong>Jamie</strong>:  I never thought about all these hidden layers before. Anything else I should know?</p>\n<p><strong>Me</strong>: Just a couple more things. <strong>404 errors</strong> are something you need to watch out for. These happen when users click on a broken link or go to a page that no longer exists. Make sure you have custom 404 pages to gently guide users back to useful content. And if you permanently remove pages, use <strong>301 redirects</strong> to send users to the new location.</p>\n<p><strong>Jamie</strong>: Oh yeah, I’ve landed on a few of those “Page Not Found” errors before. It’s annoying!</p>\n<p><strong>Me</strong>: Exactly. It’s frustrating for users and not great for SEO either. Also, if your site targets multiple countries or languages, you’ll want to use <strong>hreflang tags</strong>. These tags tell search engines which page to show for which audience.</p>\n<p><strong>Jamie</strong>: That sounds complicated, but I guess it’s important for international sites.</p>\n<p><strong>Me</strong>: It is! But overall, once you’ve got the basics down and do regular <strong>site audits</strong> using tools like <strong>Screaming Frog</strong> or <strong>Google Search Console</strong>, you’ll be able to catch most technical issues before they become a problem.</p>\n<p><strong>Jamie</strong>: So technical SEO is like making sure my website’s foundation is strong and my pipes aren’t leaking, right?</p>\n<p><strong>Me</strong>: Yep! And when it’s done right, it’s a big win for both your users and search engines. A fast, secure, and well-structured website is not only going to rank higher, but it’ll also keep visitors happy and coming back.</p>\n<p><strong>Jamie</strong>: Alright, you’ve convinced me! I’ve got some work to do. Thanks for breaking it down for me!</p>\n<hr class=\"has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong><em>LOCAL SEARCH ENGINE OPTIMISATION</em></strong></p>\n<hr class=\"has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<p><strong>Jamie</strong>: Okay, that all makes sense for big websites, but I have a small local business. Does technical SEO work differently for me?</p>\n<p><strong>Me</strong>: Actually, technical SEO can be even more important for a local business. That's because your goal isn’t just online traffic—it’s getting people to walk through your door. Local businesses need to make sure their websites are set up for both online visibility and local search intent. </p>\n<p><strong>Jamie</strong>: Yeah, foot traffic is my goal! So how does technical SEO help with that?</p>\n<p><strong>Me</strong>: For starters, your website still needs to be technically sound so search engines can crawl it properly, but the local element adds a few extra layers. One big factor is something called <strong>local SEO</strong>, which overlaps with technical SEO in a few ways.</p>\n<p><strong>Jamie</strong>: What’s local SEO? Is it like regular SEO but for businesses in a specific area?</p>\n<p><strong>Me</strong>: Exactly! Local SEO is all about optimising your online presence so people nearby can find your business when they search for things like \"coffee shop near me\" or \"best hair salon in Birmingham.\" Search engines use location data to give users the most relevant results for their area. So, for a local business like yours, it’s crucial that your website is optimised to show up in those local searches.</p>\n<p><strong>Jamie</strong>: Got it! But how does that tie into technical SEO?</p>\n<p><strong>Me</strong>: Here’s where the two meet. The technical side ensures your website has a strong foundation for local SEO to work. Here are a few things you can do to improve your local SEO using technical SEO principles:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Mobile-Friendliness</strong>: Since so many local searches happen on mobile, it’s critical that your website looks and works great on smartphones. Search engines prioritise mobile-friendly sites, especially for local searches.</li>\n<li><strong>Page Speed</strong>: Local users are often looking for quick results. If your site loads slowly, they’ll leave, and Google notices that. You can check your site speed and optimise images, reduce unnecessary scripts, and use caching to speed things up.</li>\n<li><strong>NAP Consistency</strong>: This stands for <strong>Name, Address, and Phone number</strong>. Make sure that your NAP info is consistent across your website and anywhere else it's listed online, like in directories, Yelp, or your Google Business Profile. Search engines use this info to verify your business’s credibility, and inconsistencies can hurt your rankings.</li>\n<li><strong>Google Business Profile</strong>: Speaking of which, do you have a <strong>Google Business Profile</strong>?</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Jamie</strong>: I do! I set it up a while ago but haven’t really looked at it in months.</p>\n<p><strong>Me</strong>: That’s a great start, but keeping it updated is key. Your Google Business Profile is like the centerpiece of local SEO. Make sure it’s fully filled out—business hours, categories, services you offer, photos, and of course, your NAP. Reviews are also huge! Responding to reviews and encouraging happy customers to leave them boosts your visibility and credibility.</p>\n<p><strong>Jamie</strong>: I’ll definitely check that. </p>\n<p><strong>Me</strong>:  Here’s another tip—<strong>local structured data</strong>. You remember earlier when we talked about structured data or schema markup, right? You can add specific local business schema to your website. This tells search engines things like your business type, location, hours, and more, which improves your chances of showing up in local searches and map results.</p>\n<p><strong>Jamie</strong>: Oh, I didn’t know that! So it’s like giving Google extra information to boost my ranking?</p>\n<p><strong>Me</strong>: Exactly. Structured data makes it easier for Google to understand your business and show it in rich results like <strong>Google’s local pack</strong>. That's that map with three or four businesses that shows up at the top of search results? That's prime real estate for foot traffic.</p>\n<p><strong>Jamie</strong>: Wow, that’d be amazing if my business showed up there! What else should I be focusing on?</p>\n<p><strong>Me</strong>: Another important factor is <strong>local backlinks</strong>. When local websites or directories link to your business, it signals to Google that your business is trusted and relevant in the local area. You could try reaching out to local news sites, bloggers, or even partnering with other small businesses for mutual promotion.</p>\n<p><strong>Jamie</strong>: That’s a great idea! I could definitely collaborate with other local businesses.</p>\n<p><strong>Me</strong>: Absolutely. And finally, don’t forget about <strong>location-specific content</strong>. Create blog posts and include content on your site that mentions your city, neighbourhood, or local events. This tells search engines that your business is active in the community. For example, a blog post about a local event or “best tips for shopping in Birmingham” helps boost your relevance in local searches.</p>\n<p><strong>Jamie</strong>: So, it’s not just about technical stuff but also making sure the content is locally focused?</p>\n<p><strong>Me</strong>: Exactly! It’s all part of the strategy. Technical SEO is the foundation—things like making sure your site is fast, mobile-friendly, and easy to crawl.  Local SEO is like adding a layer on top that targets the people nearby who are most likely to become customers.</p>\n<p><strong>Jamie</strong>: This makes so much sense now. I feel like I’ve got a lot to do, but I’m excited! I’ll definitely work on my Google Business Profile, structured data, and maybe even start a blog about local events.</p>\n<p><strong>Me</strong>:   Just remember, technical SEO and local SEO work hand in hand to bring both search engines and real people through your door. It’s all about making it as easy as possible for locals to find and trust your business.</p>\n<hr class=\"has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<h3 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>Why Technical SEO Matters</strong></h3>\n<hr class=\"has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<p><strong>Search Engine Crawling &amp; Indexing</strong>: Technical SEO ensures search engines like Google, Bing, and others can easily discover, crawl, and index the pages on your site. Proper technical setup allows search engines to access all necessary pages, helping them understand your site's content and structure.</p>\n<p><strong>Improved Search Rankings</strong>: Search engines reward fast, user-friendly, and well-optimized websites. Factors like site speed, mobile responsiveness, structured data, and security are crucial ranking signals.</p>\n<p><strong>User Experience</strong>: A technically sound website results in a better user experience, which can directly affect metrics like bounce rate, time on page, and conversions. Google’s Core Web Vitals are key metrics that tie user experience to ranking.</p>\n<p><strong>Competitiveness</strong>: In highly competitive industries, ensuring your website’s technical foundation is optimised gives you an edge. Even if your content and backlinks are top-tier, poor technical SEO can hold your site back.</p>\n<hr class=\"has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<h3 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>Key Components of Technical SEO</strong></h3>\n<h4><strong>1. Crawlability and Indexing</strong></h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Crawlability</strong>: Search engines need to find and \"crawl\" your website. A website's crawlability is impacted by its structure, sitemap, and internal linking. You can check your crawlability through tools like Google Search Console.</li>\n<li><strong>Sitemap</strong>: Ensure your XML sitemap is up-to-date and submitted to search engines. It helps search engines understand the structure of your site and discover new pages faster.</li>\n<li><strong>Robots.txt</strong>: This file tells search engines which pages they can and cannot crawl. Be cautious: a wrongly configured robots.txt file can block important pages from being indexed.</li>\n<li><strong>Canonical Tags</strong>: These prevent duplicate content issues by specifying the “canonical” or primary version of a page when there are multiple versions (like due to URL parameters).</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><strong>2. Site Architecture and Structure</strong></h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>URL Structure</strong>: Clean and descriptive URLs are crucial for SEO. They should be easy to read by both users and search engines, containing relevant keywords without unnecessary parameters or subdirectories.</li>\n<li><strong>Breadcrumbs</strong>: Breadcrumb navigation enhances the user experience and provides extra structure for search engines to understand your site’s hierarchy.</li>\n<li><strong>Internal Linking</strong>: Linking relevant content within your website improves navigation for users. It also helps search engines distribute \"link equity\" across pages.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><strong>3. Mobile-Friendliness</strong></h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Responsive Design</strong>: Since Google switched to mobile-first indexing, having a mobile-friendly site is essential. This means your site should adapt to various screen sizes and provide an optimal experience across devices.</li>\n<li><strong>Mobile Speed</strong>: Mobile users expect fast load times, and Google uses mobile page speed as a ranking factor. Consider AMP (Accelerated Mobile Pages) or lightweight designs for mobile users.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><strong>4. Page Speed &amp; Core Web Vitals</strong></h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Page Speed</strong>: Fast loading times are critical for both user experience and SEO rankings. Use tools like Google PageSpeed Insights or Lighthouse to measure performance.\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Reduce JavaScript/CSS</strong>: Minify and defer JavaScript to improve performance.</li>\n<li><strong>Optimise Images</strong>: Compress images without losing quality.</li>\n<li><strong>Caching</strong>: Enable browser caching and use CDNs (Content Delivery Networks) to reduce load times globally.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Core Web Vitals</strong>: Google’s set of user-centric metrics to measure page performance. The three key metrics are:\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)</strong>: Measures loading performance (should occur within 2.5 seconds).</li>\n<li><strong>First Input Delay (FID)</strong>: Measures interactivity (should be less than 100 ms).</li>\n<li><strong>Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)</strong>: Measures visual stability (should maintain a score of less than 0.1).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><strong>5. HTTPS and Security</strong></h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>HTTPS</strong>: Security is a ranking factor. Ensure your website has an SSL certificate and serves content over HTTPS rather than HTTP.</li>\n<li><strong>Mixed Content</strong>: Avoid mixed content issues, where some elements (like images or scripts) are loaded over HTTP on a HTTPS site. This can create security risks and negatively affect your rankings.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><strong>6. Structured Data &amp; Schema Markup</strong></h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Schema Markup</strong>: Schema is a standardised vocabulary that helps search engines understand the content of your pages in more detail. Implementing structured data can enhance your SERP appearance (rich snippets) by showing product reviews, FAQs, event information, etc.</li>\n<li><strong>Knowledge Graph</strong>: Adding structured data can help Google create knowledge panels for entities, improving visibility and click-through rates.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><strong>7. Duplicate Content</strong></h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Canonicalization</strong>: Use canonical tags to show the preferred version of a page to avoid duplicate content penalties.</li>\n<li><strong>URL Parameters</strong>: Properly manage URL parameters using canonical tags or through Google Search Console to avoid creating multiple versions of the same content.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><strong>8. Error Handling</strong></h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>404 Pages</strong>: Make sure your site handles 404 errors (page not found) gracefully. Use custom error pages that guide users back to useful content.</li>\n<li><strong>301 Redirects</strong>: Use 301 redirects to permanently direct old or removed pages to new content. This preserves the link equity of the old page.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><strong>9. International SEO (if applicable)</strong></h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Hreflang Tags</strong>: If your site has content for multiple languages or regions, use hreflang tags. They tell search engines which version of the page to display to users in different countries or languages.</li>\n<li><strong>Geotargeting</strong>: Set up proper country-specific targeting using Google Search Console and domain structure (ccTLDs, subdomains, or subdirectories).</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>3. <strong>Tools for Technical SEO</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Google Search Console</strong>: Vital for monitoring and optimizing crawlability, indexing issues, and search performance.</li>\n<li><strong>Google PageSpeed Insights</strong>: Measures page performance and offers suggestions for improvement.</li>\n<li><strong>Screaming Frog</strong>: A comprehensive site audit tool for identifying crawl issues, broken links, duplicate content, and more.</li>\n<li><strong>SEMrush/Ahrefs</strong>: These offer in-depth technical SEO audits alongside keyword tracking and backlink analysis.</li>\n<li><strong>Lighthouse</strong>: An open-source tool built into Chrome that helps measure and improve the performance, accessibility, and SEO of web pages.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>4. <strong>Best Practices for Technical SEO</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Keep the Site Structure Flat</strong>: A flat structure is easier for both users and search engines to navigate. In such a structure, every page is just a few clicks away from the homepage.</li>\n<li><strong>Avoid Duplicate Content</strong>: Use canonical tags, redirects, and unique content strategies to avoid duplicate content issues.</li>\n<li><strong>Regular Site Audits</strong>: Perform technical audits regularly. Use tools like Screaming Frog or SEMrush. Catch and fix issues before they affect rankings.</li>\n<li><strong>Monitor Core Web Vitals</strong>: Keep an eye on your Core Web Vitals in Google Search Console. This ensures your site meets performance standards.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>5. <strong>Website Performance</strong></h3>\n<p>Website performance directly impacts your SEO and user experience. A slow website can lead to high bounce rates, lower dwell times, and missed conversion opportunities, which indirectly affects rankings.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Better User Engagement</strong>: Faster websites lead to lower bounce rates, longer session durations, and more conversions.</li>\n<li><strong>Mobile Optimisation</strong>: As mobile traffic dominates, optimising for mobile users (speed, responsiveness) becomes more critical.</li>\n<li><strong>Reduced Server Load</strong>: Performance optimisations like caching and image optimisation reduce server strain. They help your site handle more traffic efficiently.</li>\n<li><strong>Impact on Revenue</strong>: Faster websites directly correlate with higher e-commerce sales and better customer retention rates.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>By understanding technical SEO and focusing on optimising performance, you will have a website that ranks better in search engines. It will also deliver a fast, engaging experience for users. Both of these factors lead to long-term growth and success for your website.</p>\n",

So, I click new note and a new window modal opens up so I can add a new note. when I save the new note the modal disappears.\n\nIn the note editor area I want to use a rich text editor like react quill so I can have styling options and add images, bold etc. Make sure the area where I am writing the note is fairly large. I want plenty of space to write. Make it so there is more area seen in the rich text editor.\n\nTo edit a note. When you click on a note an editor pops up in a modal that takes up most of the screen. This is where you can edit the note. When I edit the note and hit save I want the modal to disappear.\n\nI want the ability to delete a note. When I hit delete I want a message to appear asking me if I am sure I want to delete the note. When I say yes to that message I will be told the note has been successfully deleted.\n\nI want to have the ability to search my notes. Give me a search bar at the top left that I can type in and it dynamically shows me relevant notes. the search bar will take up half the screen.\n\n\nI want the ability to use ChatGPT to summarize all my notes. I want to connect my app to the ChatGPT api. I want it to have a button on the right next to the add new note button that says summarize notes. When pressed I want it to send back a summary of all my notes from the API.\n\nThe whole thing will be built using the mobile-first approach so it is responsive.</code></pre>\n\n<div aria-hidden=\"true\"></div>\n<p><strong>It didn't go as smoothly for me as it did in the video. </strong></p>\n<p>You get to ask questions and add anything that is missing and another version of code is written.

    "slug": "migrating-from-wordpress-to-django",
    "introduction": "My experience with using Django has grown in leaps and bounds since qualifying in March 2024. All I have done is focused ALL my attention of getting really great at using it for what is now yearly a year.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs a result I made the decision to migrate my sites from WordPress to Django. This process is only worth undertaking if you are thinking about adding more than just a blog to your site.",
    "content": "The migrating from WordPress to Django process involved several challenges. It ultimately resulted in a successful migration with all content preserved and properly formatted. In this post, I&#39;ll share the approach, tools, and lessons learned during this migration journey.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI am assuming if you are reading this you already know what Django is and why it is so great. Otherwise you can read more about it here - What is Django?<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Why Migrate from WordPress to Django?</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nBefore diving into the how, let&#39;s briefly discuss why you might want to make this transition:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n- Greater development flexibility: Django gives you complete control over your codebase<br />\r\n<br />\r\n- Performance improvements: Django sites often load faster than WordPress installations<br />\r\n<br />\r\n- Security benefits: Fewer plugins means a reduced attack surface<br />\r\n<br />\r\n- Learning opportunity: Working with Python and Django enhances your skillset<br />\r\n<br />\r\n- Integration with other Python tools: Connect easily with data science libraries and more<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>The Migration Process Overview</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe WordPress to Django migration followed these general steps:<br />\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<div style=\"margin-left:40px\">1. Exporting content from WordPress<br />\r\n<br />\r\n2. Converting WordPress XML export to JSON<br />\r\n<br />\r\n3. Creating a Django data structure compatible with our models<br />\r\n<br />\r\n4. Developing custom management commands<br />\r\n<br />\r\n5. Importing data in batches<br />\r\n<br />\r\n6. Validating and cleaning the imported content</div>\r\n<br />\r\nLet&#39;s look at each of these steps in detail.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Step 1: Exporting WordPress Content</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe migration begins with exporting your WordPress content. WordPress provides a built-in tool for this:<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLog in to your WordPress admin dashboard<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNavigate to Tools &rarr; Export<br />\r\n<br />\r\nChoose &quot;All content&quot; to include posts, pages, comments, etc.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDownload the XML file<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis XML file contains all your posts, pages, media, categories, tags, and other content in WordPress&#39;s WXR (WordPress eXtended RSS) format.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<em>IMPORTANT:</em> If you have content in DRAFT form or waiting to be published, these posts will not move over well!<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Step 2: Converting WordPress XML to JSON</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nWorking with XML can be cumbersome, so I converted the export file to JSON for easier processing:<br />\r\n<br />\r\nVarious online tools can perform this conversion - I used https://jsonformatter.org/xml-to-json<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAlternatively, you can use Python libraries like xmltodict to convert XML to JSON<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe resulting JSON file is more manageable for parsing and importing<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis conversion step simplifies the data extraction process and makes it easier to map WordPress fields to Django model fields.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Step 3: Creating Django Data Structures</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nBefore importing the data, I needed to ensure my Django models could accommodate the WordPress content structure. This involved:<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnalysing the WordPress data schema (posts, categories, tags, etc.)<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCreating or modifying Django models to match this structure<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSetting up appropriate relationships between models<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMy Django blog application uses models for:<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPosts (content, publication date, status)<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCategories (name, slug)<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMedia (images and attachments)<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Step 4: Developing Custom Management Commands</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe heart of the migration process involved creating several Django management commands:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>The Import Command</strong><br />\r\nThis command was responsible for:<br />\r\n-Reading the JSON data<br />\r\n-Parsing WordPress posts and categories<br />\r\n-Creating corresponding Django objects<br />\r\n-Handling media imports<br />\r\n-Managing relationships between content<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>The Content Cleaning Command</strong><br />\r\n-WordPress content often contains HTML that doesn&#39;t translate well to Django templates. This command:<br />\r\n-Removes unnecessary WordPress-specific HTML<br />\r\n-Fixes formatting issues<br />\r\n-Cleans up embedded media<br />\r\n-Ensures content renders properly in Django templates<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>The Slug Validation Command</strong><br />\r\n-WordPress and Django handle URL slugs differently. This command:<br />\r\n-Validates all post and category slugs<br />\r\n-Identifies slugs that don&#39;t match Django&#39;s URL patterns<br />\r\n-Reports problematic content that needs attention<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>The Slug Fixing Command</strong><br />\r\nTo address issues identified by the validation command, this tool:<br />\r\n-Automatically regenerates invalid slugs from post titles<br />\r\n-Ensures unique slugs across all content<br />\r\n-Updates database records with corrected slugs<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Step 5: Importing Data in Batches</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nImporting all content at once can be risky and resource-intensive. Instead, I used a batch processing approach:<br />\r\n<br />\r\nImported content in small batches (5-10 posts at a time)<br />\r\n<br />\r\nUsed offset parameters to control which content was imported<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAdded year/month filters to organize imports chronologically<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCreated a wrapper script to automate the batch process<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis approach provided several benefits:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n-Easier to troubleshoot if issues arose<br />\r\n-Reduced server load during imports<br />\r\n-Allowed for pausing and resuming the import process<br />\r\n-Provided better visibility into progress<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Step 6: Validating and Cleaning Imported Content</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter importing, several quality assurance steps ensured everything was working properly:<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRunning the validation command to check for URL resolution issues<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCleaning WordPress-specific HTML and formatting<br />\r\n<br />\r\nChecking template rendering for all imported content<br />\r\n<br />\r\nVerifying media and embedded content displayed correctly<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCommon Challenges and Solutions<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDuring the migration, I encountered several challenges that required specific solutions:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<em>Invalid Slug Formats</em><br />\r\n<strong>Problem</strong>: WordPress sometimes uses query parameter formats in slugs (like ?p=123) that aren&#39;t compatible with Django&#39;s URL patterns.<br />\r\n<strong>Solution:</strong> Created a custom management command that identifies these slugs and automatically regenerates them from post titles, ensuring they match Django&#39;s URL pattern requirements.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<em>WordPress Shortcodes</em><br />\r\n<strong>Problem:</strong> WordPress content often contains shortcodes ([gallery], [caption], etc.) that don&#39;t work in Django.<br />\r\n<strong>Solution:</strong> The content cleaning command identifies and processes these shortcodes, either converting them to standard HTML or removing them when appropriate.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<em>Media Handling</em><br />\r\n<strong>Problem: </strong>WordPress stores media in a specific directory structure that differs from Django&#39;s approach.<br />\r\n<strong>Solution:</strong> Implemented media downloading and remapping to ensure all images and attachments were correctly imported and properly referenced in content.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<em>Content Formatting</em><br />\r\n<strong>Problem:</strong> WordPress adds various classes, inline styles, and non-semantic HTML that can cause rendering issues.<br />\r\n<strong>Solution:</strong> Created a content cleaning process using BeautifulSoup that sanitizes HTML, removes unnecessary attributes, and improves semantic structure.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<em>Draft Posts</em><br />\r\n<strong>Problem:</strong> Some WordPress posts might be in draft status but still need to be imported.<br />\r\n<strong>Solution:</strong> The import command preserves post status, ensuring draft posts remain unpublished in the Django site while still being imported.<br />\r\nLessons Learned<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>This migration taught me several valuable lessons:</strong><br />\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<div style=\"margin-left:40px\">1. Start with a small test set: Import a few representative posts first to identify potential issues before running the full import.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n2. Validate early and often: Create validation tools from the beginning to catch issues as they arise.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n3. Plan for content cleaning: WordPress content almost always needs cleaning to work well in Django templates.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n4. Batch processing is essential: Breaking the import into manageable chunks makes troubleshooting much easier.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n5. Keep track of what&#39;s imported: Use logging and tracking to know which content has been successfully imported.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n6. Watch out for draft posts: Be aware of post status and publication dates when importing.</div>\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMigrating from WordPress to Django is a complex but rewarding process. By breaking it down into methodical steps and creating custom tools to handle specific challenges, you can successfully transition your content while maintaining its integrity.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe management commands created for this process can be reused for future content migrations, making them valuable additions to your Django toolkit. While the initial setup requires effort, the long-term benefits of having your content in a flexible, powerful framework like Django make the migration well worth it.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&nbsp;",
